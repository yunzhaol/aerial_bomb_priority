**Composition**

1. *What do the instances that comprise the dataset represent (for example, documents, photos, people, countries)? Are there multiple types of instances (for example, movies, users, and ratings; people and interactions between them; nodes and edges)? Please provide a description.*
	- Each instance represents an aerial bombing mission during World War II, specifically targeting German industries. The data includes mission details, targets, bomb tonnage, and the countries involved.

2. *How many instances are there in total (of each type, if appropriate)?*
	- The dataset for modeling consists of approximately 5,000 instances, each corresponding to a separate bombing mission.

3. *Does the dataset contain all possible instances or is it a sample (not necessarily random) of instances from a larger set? If the dataset is a sample, then what is the larger set? Is the sample representative of the larger set (for example, geographic coverage)? If so, please describe how this representativeness was validated/verified. If it is not representative of the larger set, please describe why not (for example, to cover a more diverse range of instances, because instances were withheld or unavailable).*
	- The dataset is a selective sample from a larger set of wartime records, specifically filtered to focus on missions targeting Germany. The sample was chosen to represent a cross-section of different mission types and target priorities, ensuring a comprehensive analysis of strategic bombing tactics.

4. *What data does each instance consist of? "Raw" data (for example, unprocessed text or images) or features? In either case, please provide a description.*
	- Each instance consists of structured data detailing the mission date, target type, bomb tonnage, the originating country of the mission, and the outcome. This data is derived from historical mission reports and operational records.

5. *Is there a label or target associated with each instance? If so, please provide a description.*
	- Each mission instance includes labels categorizing the target priority (e.g., primary, secondary, opportunistic, last resort) based on strategic importance.

6. *Is any information missing from individual instances? If so, please provide a description, explaining why this information is missing (for example, because it was unavailable). This does not include intentionally removed information, but might include, for example, redacted text.*
	- Some instances may lack complete details on the exact number of aircraft involved or the precise impact of the bombing, due to the limitations in the historical records available.

7. *Are relationships between individual instances made explicit (for example, users' movie ratings, social network links)? If so, please describe how these relationships are made explicit.*
	- Relationships are made explicit through the targeting data, where multiple missions targeting the same industry or geographic area are linked, showing the strategic focus over time.

8. *Are there recommended data splits (for example, training, development/validation, testing)? If so, please provide a description of these splits, explaining the rationale behind them.*
	- Split into a training set (80%) and a testing set (20%) will be fine.

9. *Are there any errors, sources of noise, or redundancies in the dataset? If so, please provide a description.*
	- Given the historical nature of the data, some level of noise and error is inherent, such as discrepancies in mission records or incomplete documentation of outcomes.

10. *Is the dataset self-contained, or does it link to or otherwise rely on external resources (for example, websites, tweets, other datasets)? If it links to or relies on external resources, a) are there guarantees that they will exist, and remain constant, over time; b) are there official archival versions of the complete dataset (that is, including the external resources as they existed at the time the dataset was created); c) are there any restrictions (for example, licenses, fees) associated with any of the external resources that might apply to a dataset consumer? Please provide descriptions of all external resources and any restrictions associated with them, as well as links or other access points, as appropriate.*
	- The dataset is primarily self-contained, but it is supplemented by external archival resources and historical databases, which are maintained by reputable historical and governmental archives. These resources are expected to remain available and consistent over time, with no associated fees for academic use.

11. *Does the dataset contain data that might be considered confidential (for example, data that is protected by legal privilege or by doctor-patient confidentiality, data that includes the content of individuals' non-public communications)? If so, please provide a description.*
	- The dataset does not contain confidential information. All data is derived from publicly available historical records.

12. *Does the dataset contain data that, if viewed directly, might be offensive, insulting, threatening, or might otherwise cause anxiety? If so, please describe why.*
	- The dataset contains descriptions of wartime activities, which may be disturbing but are presented in a factual and historical context.

13. *Does the dataset identify any sub-populations (for example, by age, gender)? If so, please describe how these subpopulations are identified and provide a description of their respective distributions within the dataset.*
	- The dataset does not identify sub-populations as it focuses solely on military missions and does not include demographic information.

14. *Is it possible to identify individuals (that is, one or more natural persons), either directly or indirectly (that is, in combination with other data) from the dataset? If so, please describe how.*
	- It is not possible to identify individuals directly from this dataset as it does not contain personal information or identifiers.

15. *Does the dataset contain data that might be considered sensitive in any way (for example, data that reveals race or ethnic origins, sexual orientations, religious beliefs, political opinions or union memberships, or locations; financial or health data; biometric or genetic data; forms of government identification, such as social security numbers; criminal history)? If so, please provide a description.*
	- The dataset does not contain sensitive information as defined above. It strictly includes operational details of military missions.

16. *Any other comments?*
	- This dataset provides a unique perspective on a pivotal aspect of World War II and is intended for academic research and educational purposes to further understand the strategic decisions of that era.
